      <description>Why it matters? Oftentimes, you see a bad review of a movie from critics and think that you won&amp;rsquo;t enjoy the movie. However, when you go to a theater and watch the movie for yourself, you find out you actually enjoy the movie. This happened to me when I watched Extraction 2, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. The opposite situation also happened and sometimes, critic ratings are similar to user ratings such as Fast X and John Wick 4.</description>

      <description>Why it matters? In Korea, a car navigation system notifies me whenever I enter an &amp;ldquo;accident-prone area&amp;rdquo;. This especially helped me to stay alert in those areas so that I don&amp;rsquo;t get into an accident. However, as far as I know, there is no such service in a navigation system in the US. Thus, I was curious about what areas in San Diego are &amp;ldquo;accident-prone areas&amp;rdquo; so that I and other drivers in San Diego need to be extra cautious while driving.</description>
