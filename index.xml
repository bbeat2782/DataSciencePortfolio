      <description>Why it matters? Oftentimes, you see a bad review of a movie from critics and think that you won&amp;rsquo;t enjoy the movie. However, when you go to a theater and watch the movie for yourself, you find out you actually enjoy the movie more than you thought. This happened to me when I watched Extraction 2, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. The opposite situation also happened, and sometimes, critic ratings are similar to user ratings such as Fast X and John Wick 4.</description>

      <description>Why it matters? In Korea, car navigation systems notify drivers when they enter &amp;lsquo;accident-prone areas,&amp;rsquo; helping them stay alert and avoid potential accidents. However, similar services are not commonly available in navigation systems in the US. As a result, I became curious about identifying accident-prone areas in San Diego to raise awareness when I drive in the future.
Moreover, as an inexperienced driver, I have been told lane changes are the most challenging task when driving in Korea, partly due to narrow lanes.</description>
